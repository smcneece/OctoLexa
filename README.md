## üì± How to Find Your Notification Entities

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Developer Tools ‚Üí Services no longer shows notify services as of recent Home Assistant updates. Here's the reliable method:

The `notify.` domain is funky and doesn't always show up in the **Entities** list. Here's the best way to find the right names:

### üì± Mobile App Notify Entity
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Create Automation**
2. Click **Create a new automation**
3. Scroll down to **Then Do** and click **Add Action**
4. In the search bar, type part of your mobile device name or `mobile_app`
5. Select your device, such as `notify.mobile_app_shawn_cell`
6. Click the **three dots ‚Üí Edit in YAML**
7. You'll see something like:
   ```yaml
   action: notify.mobile_app_shawn_cell
   ```
8. Copy the value after `action:` and paste it into the blueprint.

### üó£Ô∏è Alexa Notify Entity

**Make sure [Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) is installed and configured.**

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Create Automation**
2. Click **Create a new automation**
3. Scroll down to **Then Do** and click **Add Action**
4. In the search bar, type part of your Alexa device name or `alexa_media`
5. Select your device, such as `notify.alexa_media_echoclockdot`
6. Click the **three dots ‚Üí Edit in YAML**
7. You'll see something like:
   ```yaml
   action: notify.alexa_media_echoclockdot
   ```
8. Copy the value after `action:` and paste it into the blueprint.

üí° *Want multiple Echos to announce together?*  
Use a group notify like `notify.alexa_media_everywhere`.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How to Create Alexa Groups

1. Open the **Alexa app**
2. Tap **Devices**
3. Tap the **"+" icon ‚Üí Combine Speakers**
4. Choose **Multi-Room Music**
5. Pick your Echo devices and name the group
6. It will appear as: `notify.alexa_media_<group_name>`

> **Note:** Alexa Groups must be created inside the Alexa app first before they appear as available notify targets.

---

## üí¨ Example Notification Messages

- **Alexa**: "Print job started on Chiron Right."
- **Mobile**: "Print job started on Chiron Right @ 09:39 AM."
- **Persistent UI**: "Print job completed on Chiron Right @ 02:15 PM."
